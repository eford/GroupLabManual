 - Are you a science communicator? No? Are you sure about that? Science communication weaves its way through just about every aspect of being a scientist. But few graduate programs actually teach their students how to do it. I'm going to present a few foundational aspects of communicating science—yours or someone else's—that will help you get your message across to the intended people in a clear and effective way. After, there will be Q&A and a discussion about putting these principles into practice in your career, be it as an academic, a science journalist like me, or anything under the sky.
