Any notes shared on these pages represent personal notes of group members.  While they may be useful for remembering which talk/poster/presenter/paper was about a particular topic, they should not be treated as an authoritative source.
Given inherent difficulty of taking notes during meetings, they are likely incomplete and may contain errors, from spelling to content.
