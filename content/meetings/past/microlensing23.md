## Exploit

What is your goal?

___
## Exploit

- Find optima: Itterative optimizer
- Draw posterior sample (near optimum): MCMC
- Marginalize around optimum: Importance Sampling

___

## Exploit: Optimization

Optimization algorithms using gradients
- Differentiable form of Kepler (Pal 2009)
- Derivatives of Kepler equation by hand
- Autodifferentiation

___
## Exploit: Posterior Sampling

Artisinal MCMC proposals
- Use physically motivated proposals for correlated parameters (Ford 2005)
   - Useful when nearly degeneracies
   - Multiple parameterizations for multiple regimes.
- Enable jumps between few known modes (Hu+ 2014)
- Be extra careful to use well-motivated priors
___
## Exploit: Posterior Sampling

Workhorse algorithms
- Ensemble samplers (D ~ 10's)
- Differential Evolution MCMC (ter Braak 2006; Nelson+ 2013)
- Affine invariant ensemble sampler (Goodman & Weare 2010)

Often "good enough" and saves expert from spending time to design artisinal MCMC proposals

___
## Exploit: Posterior Sampling

Workhorse algorithms
- Geometric samplers (large D)
- HMC + No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS; Hoffman & Gelman 2014)
- Geometric Adaptive Monte Carlo (Tuchow+ 2019)

Combine:
- Artisinal proposals (e.g., between modes)
- Ensemble samplers (most important parameters)

___
## Exploit: Posterior Sampling

Weighting of degenerate solutions comes out naturally

Warnings:
- Posterior width depends on measurement uncertainties
- Correlated noise also affects weighting and location of posterior modes

___
## Exploit: Posterior Sampling

Suggestions:
- Report what you measure well (even if it's not what physicists want)
- Particularly important for summmary statistics
- Can avoid some biases
   - e & omega vs e sin(omega) & e cos(omega)
   - Similar for inclinations
